Recommendations for creating an effective OG image:
1. Size: 1200x630 pixels (optimal for most social platforms)
2. Include NAGA logo and name prominently
3. Use a dark background consistent with site theme
4. Include a brief tagline like "Innovative App Solutions"
5. Keep text minimal and highly readable
6. Ensure good contrast for visibility
7. Avoid placing critical elements at the edges (may get cropped)
